## [2025-07-11] - Billing Functionality Fixes

### Added
- `/backend/app/api/deps.py` - Created API dependencies file with authentication and tenant management functions
- Mock billing endpoints in `/backend/app/main.py` for testing without Stripe integration

### Changed
- `/backend/app/config.py` - Added Stripe configuration variables (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, and price IDs)
- `/backend/app/services/billing/stripe_service.py` - Fixed import issues and added missing methods:
  - Added `UsageRecord` import
  - Implemented `get_usage_summary()` method
  - Implemented `get_invoices()` method
  - Implemented `download_invoice()` method
  - Implemented `record_usage()` method
  - Implemented `remove_payment_method()` method
- `/backend/app/models/tenant.py` - Added `is_active` field to Tenant model

### Fixed
- Frontend billing service import error by ensuring `billing.ts` exists in the services directory
- Missing dependency imports in billing API endpoints
- Stripe service initialization issues with proper environment variable loading

### Technical Details
- The billing system now supports both mock mode (for development/testing) and full Stripe integration
- Environment variables for Stripe are properly loaded through the Pydantic settings configuration
- All async/await patterns are properly implemented in the billing service
- The system supports subscription management, payment methods, invoicing, and usage tracking

### Notes
- To enable full Stripe functionality, ensure these environment variables are set in your `.env` file:
  - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
  - STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
  - STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
  - STRIPE_PRICE_CONTENT_OPTIMIZATION
  - STRIPE_PRICE_API_CALLS
  - STRIPE_PRICE_TREND_ANALYSIS
  - STRIPE_PRICE_LLM_OPTIMIZATION
- The mock endpoints in `/backend/app/main.py` provide sample data for testing the frontend without Stripe

## [2025-07-11] - Real Backend Integration

### Added
- `/backend/app/services/elasticsearch_service.py` - Elasticsearch service for content indexing, search, and analytics
- `/backend/app/services/neo4j_service.py` - Neo4j service for knowledge graph operations
- `/backend/app/services/weaviate_service.py` - Weaviate service for vector database and semantic search
- `/backend/requirements-services.txt` - Requirements file for database service dependencies
- New API endpoints:
  - `/api/v1/search` - Real-time search with keyword, semantic, and hybrid modes
  - `/api/v1/health/services` - Health check for all backend services

### Changed
- `/frontend/src/pages/Billing.tsx` - Fixed import from `@tanstack/react-query` to `react-query`
- `/backend/app/main.py` - Major update to connect all endpoints to real backend services:
  - Added lifespan handler for database initialization
  - Updated analytics endpoints to fetch data from Elasticsearch
  - Enhanced content analysis to store data in all three backends (Elasticsearch, Neo4j, Weaviate)
  - Modified knowledge graph endpoint to fetch from Neo4j with fallback to mock data
  - All endpoints now indicate data source (real/mock/computed)
  - Added intelligent fallback to mock data when services are unavailable

### Fixed
- React Query import error in Billing component
- All hardcoded values replaced with real data fetching or intelligent computation
- Proper error handling with graceful fallbacks

### Technical Details
- **Elasticsearch Integration**:
  - Content indexing with full-text search
  - Analytics data aggregation
  - Time-series data for charts
  - Content insights and statistics

- **Neo4j Integration**:
  - Knowledge graph construction from content analysis
  - Entity and relationship management
  - Graph traversal for content connections
  - Semantic relationship tracking

- **Weaviate Integration**:
  - Vector embeddings for semantic search
  - Content similarity calculations
  - Semantic clustering capabilities
  - Multi-modal content support

- **Data Flow**:
  1. Content analysis stores data in all three backends
  2. Search uses Elasticsearch for keywords, Weaviate for semantic
  3. Knowledge graph visualization pulls from Neo4j
  4. Analytics aggregates from Elasticsearch

### Notes
- All endpoints gracefully fallback to mock data if services are unavailable
- The system is designed to work with or without the backend services running
- To enable full functionality, ensure Neo4j, Elasticsearch, and Weaviate are running
- Install backend service dependencies: `pip install -r backend/requirements-services.txt`

## [2025-07-12] - React Query Import Error Workaround

### Added
- `/frontend/src/pages/BillingSimple.tsx` - Created simplified billing page without react-query dependencies as a workaround for persistent Vite caching issue
  - Uses direct API calls with useState and useEffect instead of react-query hooks
  - Provides full billing functionality without the import error
  - Maintains the same UI/UX as the original Billing component

### Changed
- `/frontend/src/pages/Billing.tsx` - Import statement already correctly uses 'react-query' instead of '@tanstack/react-query'

### Fixed
- Created workaround for persistent Vite cache issue showing "@tanstack/react-query" import error despite correct code
- The error persisted even after:
  - Correcting the import to 'react-query' (which is installed in the project)
  - Clearing Vite cache with `rm -rf node_modules/.vite`
  - Restarting the development server

### Technical Details
- The original Billing.tsx file has the correct import: `import { useQuery, useMutation } from 'react-query';`
- However, Vite continues to show cached error messages about @tanstack/react-query
- BillingSimple.tsx implements the same functionality without react-query:
  - Uses `useState` for managing loading, data, and error states
  - Uses `useEffect` for initial data fetching
  - Direct API calls via `billingAPI.getBillingOverview()`
  - Maintains all UI components and features from the original

### Notes
- To use the workaround, update the router in App.tsx to import BillingSimple instead of Billing
- This is a temporary solution while investigating the Vite caching issue
- The original Billing.tsx code is correct and should work once the cache issue is resolved
- Consider clearing all caches: `rm -rf node_modules/.vite node_modules/.cache`

- Tooltips use Material-UI's Tooltip component with 500ms delay
- Onboarding state persisted in localStorage
- Step numbers integrated into navigation icons
- Workflow guide tracks current step based on completed tasks

3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information is revealed as needed
4. **Guided Navigation**: Users always know what to do next
5. **Educational Content**: Platform teaches LLM optimization concepts
