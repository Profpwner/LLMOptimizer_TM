# LLM Optimizer Implementation Plan

## Current Status
After reviewing the codebase, the infrastructure is solid but the core LLM optimization features are missing. This plan focuses on implementing the actual value proposition of the system.

## Phase 1: Core Semantic Saturation Engine (Task 4.1-4.5)

### ML Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Install ML dependencies in ml-service (sentence-transformers, torch, numpy, scikit-learn)
- [ ] Set up vector database client (Pinecone or Weaviate)
- [ ] Configure ML model loading and caching
- [ ] Add ML-specific environment variables

### Semantic Embedding Generation
- [ ] Implement text preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Create embedding generation service using sentence-transformers
- [ ] Add batch processing for multiple content pieces
- [ ] Implement embedding storage in vector database

### Similarity Computation Engine
- [ ] Build cosine similarity computation
- [ ] Implement k-nearest neighbors search
- [ ] Create similarity threshold configuration
- [ ] Add similarity caching for performance

### Content Mesh Algorithm
- [ ] Design graph structure for content relationships
- [ ] Implement mesh generation from similarity scores
- [ ] Create visualization data structure
- [ ] Add mesh persistence and updates

### Gap Analysis Engine
- [ ] Implement topic extraction from content
- [ ] Build coverage analysis algorithm
- [ ] Create gap identification logic
- [ ] Generate gap recommendations

## Phase 2: LLM Platform Integration (Task 5.1-5.4)

### OpenAI API Integration
- [ ] Create OpenAI client with authentication
- [ ] Implement query generation for brand visibility
- [ ] Add response parsing and analysis
- [ ] Implement error handling and retries

### Claude API Integration
- [ ] Create Anthropic client setup
- [ ] Implement Claude-specific query formats
- [ ] Add response parsing for Claude format
- [ ] Handle rate limiting

### Unified LLM Interface
- [ ] Design common interface for all LLM platforms
- [ ] Implement platform-specific adapters
- [ ] Create response normalization
- [ ] Add platform selection logic

### Citation Extraction
- [ ] Build regex patterns for URL extraction
- [ ] Implement citation validation
- [ ] Create citation ranking algorithm
- [ ] Add citation storage

## Phase 3: Integration

### ML Service Integration
- [ ] Connect embedding generation to content service
- [ ] Wire up optimization engine endpoints
- [ ] Implement async processing with Celery
- [ ] Add progress tracking

### API Gateway Updates
- [ ] Implement actual proxy routing (not placeholders)
- [ ] Add authentication middleware
- [ ] Configure service discovery
- [ ] Add request/response logging

### End-to-End Flow
- [ ] Test content input to embedding generation
- [ ] Verify optimization suggestions generation
- [ ] Ensure LLM monitoring data flow
- [ ] Add integration tests

## Phase 4: Basic Dashboard (Task 13)

### Visibility Scores
- [ ] Create visibility score calculation
- [ ] Build score visualization component
- [ ] Add historical tracking
- [ ] Implement score breakdown

### Optimization Suggestions
- [ ] Design suggestion data structure
- [ ] Create suggestion ranking algorithm
- [ ] Build suggestion display component
- [ ] Add implementation tracking

### Export Functionality
- [ ] Implement PDF report generation
- [ ] Create Excel export
- [ ] Add API export endpoint
- [ ] Build report templates

## Implementation Notes
- Keep each change small and focused
- Test each component individually before integration
- Use existing infrastructure (Redis, MongoDB, etc.)
- Leverage the working crawler and content services
- Maintain simplicity over complexity

## Progress Tracking
- Started: [Date]
- Current Phase: Not started
- Blockers: None
- Next Steps: Begin with ML infrastructure setup
