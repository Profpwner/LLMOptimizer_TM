Implement progress tracking system:\n```typescript\ninterface UserProgress {\n  userId: string;\n  completedTasks: string[];\n  currentLevel: number;\n  achievements: Achievement[];\n  nextRecommendations: string[];\n}\n\nconst ProgressTracker: React.FC = () => {\n  const [progress, setProgress] = useState<UserProgress | null>(null);\n  \n  const trackProgress = (taskId: string) => {\n    const updatedProgress = {\n      ...progress,\n      completedTasks: [...progress.completedTasks, taskId]\n    };\n    setProgress(updatedProgress);\n    saveProgress(updatedProgress);\n  };\n  \n  return (\n    <div className=\"progress-dashboard\">\n      <ProgressRing percentage={calculateCompletionPercentage(progress)} />\n      <AchievementBadges achievements={progress?.achievements || []} />\n      <NextSteps recommendations={progress?.nextRecommendations || []} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n7. Build personalized recommendation engine:\n```python\nclass RecommendationEngine:\n    def __init__(self, user_profile: UserProfile):\n        self.user_profile = user_profile\n        self.ml_model = load_recommendation_model()\n    \n    def generate_recommendations(self) -> List[Recommendation]:\n        user_features = self.extract_user_features()\n        content_features = self.get_content_features()\n        \n        recommendations = self.ml_model.predict(\n            user_features, content_features\n        )\n        \n        return self.rank_recommendations(recommendations)\n    \n    def extract_user_features(self) -> Dict:\n        return {\n            'industry': self.user_profile.industry,\n            'experience_level': self.user_profile.experience_level,\n            'goals': self.user_profile.goals,\n            'content_types': self.user_profile.preferred_content_types\n        }\n```",
